Shippable
=========

`Shippable <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shippable>`_ is a hosted cloud
platform that provides hosted continuous integration, deployment, and testing
to `GitHub <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub>`_ and
`BitBucket <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitbucket>`_ repositories.
Shippable's continuous integration service is built using Docker.

Shippable is configured by adding a file named ``shippable.yml``, which is a
`YAML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ format text file, to the root
directory of the GitHub repository or you can use your Travis CI configuration
file ``.travis.yml``.

Shippable automatically detects when a commit has been made and pushed to a
repository that is using Shippable, and each time this happens, it will
try to build the project using :ref:`cmd_ci` command. This includes commits to
all branches, not just to the master branch. Shippable will also build and run
pull requests. When that process has completed, it will notify a developer in
the way it has been configured to do so â€” for example, by sending an email
containing the build results (showing success or failure), or by posting a
message on an IRC channel. It can be configured to build project on a range of
different :ref:`platforms`.

Integration
-----------

Please put ``shippable.yml`` or ``.travis.yml`` to the root directory of the
GitHub repository.

.. code-block:: yaml

    language: python
    python:
        - "2.7"

    env:
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC=path/to/source/file.c
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC=path/to/source/file.ino
        - PLATFORMIO_CI_SRC=path/to/source/directory

    install:
        - pip install -U platformio

    script:
        - platformio ci --board=<ID_1> --board=<ID_2> --board=<ID_N>


For more details as for PlatformIO build process please look into :ref:`cmd_ci`
command.
