[Errno 1] Operation not permitted

Program "platformio" not found in PATH
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Where is ``platformio`` binary installed? Run this command in Terminal

.. code-block:: bash

    # for Unix
    which platformio
    echo $PATH
 Windows OS
    where platformio
    echo %PATH%

For example, ``which platformio`` is equal to ``/usr/local/bin/platformio``,
then `PATH (wiki) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)>`_
should contain ``/usr/local/bin`` directory.

**Unix Users**: You can make "symlinks" from ``platformio`` program to the
``bin`` directory which is included in ``$PATH``. For example,
see `issue #272 <https://github.com/platformio/platformio-core/issues/272#issuecomment-133626112>`_.
