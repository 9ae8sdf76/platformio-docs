Configuration
-------------

Please use ``lpmsp430g2553`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:lpmsp430g2553]
  platform = timsp430
  board = lpmsp430g2553

You can override default TI LaunchPad MSP-EXP430G2553LP settings per build environment using
``board_{JSON.PATH}`` option, where ``{JSON.PATH}`` is a path from
board manifest `lpmsp430g2553.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-timsp430/blob/master/boards/lpmsp430g2553.json>`_. For example,

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:lpmsp430g2553]
  platform = timsp430
  board = lpmsp430g2553

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = msp430g2553

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 16000000L

Debugging
---------

:ref:`piodebug` - "1-click" solution for debugging with a zero configuration.

.. warning::
    You will need to install debug tool drivers depending on your system.
    Please click on compatible debug tool below for the further
    instructions and configuration information.

You can switch between debugging :ref:`debugging_tools` using
:ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in :ref:`projectconf`.

TI LaunchPad MSP-EXP430G2553LP has on-board debug probe and **IS READY** for debugging. You don't need to use/buy external debug probe.
