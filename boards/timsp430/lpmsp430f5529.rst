TI LaunchPad MSP-EXP430F5529LP
==============================

.. contents::

Platform :ref:`platform_timsp430`: MSP430 microcontrollers (MCUs) from Texas Instruments (TI) are 16-bit, RISC-based, mixed-signal processors designed for ultra-low power. These MCUs offer the lowest power consumption and the perfect mix of integrated peripherals for thousands of applications.

System
------

.. list-table::

  * - **Microcontroller**
    - MSP430F5529
  * - **Frequency**
    - 16Mhz
  * - **Flash**
    - 128KB
  * - **RAM**

    - `TI <http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpads-msp430-msp-exp430f5529lp.html?utm_source=platformio&utm_medium=docs>`__


Configuration
-------------

Please use ``lpmsp430f5529`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:lpmsp430f5529]
  platform = timsp430
  board = lpmsp430f5529

You can override default TI LaunchPad MSP-EXP430F5529LP settings per build environment using
``board_{JSON.PATH}`` option, where ``{JSON.PATH}`` is a path from
board manifest `lpmsp430f5529.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-timsp430/blob/master/boards/lpmsp430f5529.json>`_. For example,

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:lpmsp430f5529]
  platform = timsp430
  board = lpmsp430f5529

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = msp430f5529

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 16000000L

Debugging
---------

:ref:`piodebug` - "1-click" solution for debugging with a zero configuration.

.. warning::
    You will need to install debug tool drivers depending on your system.
    Please click on compatible debug tool below for the further
    instructions and configuration information.

You can switch between debugging :ref:`debugging_tools` using
:ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in :ref:`projectconf`.

TI LaunchPad MSP-EXP430F5529LP has on-board debug probe and **IS READY** for debugging. You don't need to use/buy external debug probe.
