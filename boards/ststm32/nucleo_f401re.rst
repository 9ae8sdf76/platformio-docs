Hardware
--------

Platform :ref:`platform_ststm32`: The STM32 family of 32-bit Flash MCUs based on the ARM Cortex-M processor is designed to offer new degrees of freedom to MCU users. It offers a 32-bit product range that combines very high performance, real-time capabilities, digital signal processing, and low-power, low-voltage operation, while maintaining full integration and ease of development.

.. list-table::

  * - **Microcontroller**
    - STM32F401RET6
  * - **Frequency**
    - 84MHz
  * - **Flash**
    - 512KB

Configuration
-------------

Please use ``nucleo_f401re`` ID for :ref:`projectconf_env_board` option in :ref:`projectconf`:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:nucleo_f401re]
  platform = ststm32
  board = nucleo_f401re

You can override default ST Nucleo F401RE settings per build environment using
``board_***`` option, where ``***`` is a JSON object path from
board manifest `nucleo_f401re.json <https://github.com/platformio/platform-ststm32/blob/master/boards/nucleo_f401re.json>`_. For example,
``board_build.mcu``, ``board_build.f_cpu``, etc.

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:nucleo_f401re]
  platform = ststm32
  board = nucleo_f401re

  ; change microcontroller
  board_build.mcu = stm32f401ret6

  ; change MCU frequency
  board_build.f_cpu = 84000000L


Uploading
---------
ST Nucleo F401RE supports the next uploading protocols:

* ``jlink``
* ``stlink``
* ``blackmagic``
* ``mbed``

Default protocol is ``mbed``

You can change upload protocol using :ref:`projectconf_upload_protocol` option:

.. code-block:: ini

  [env:nucleo_f401re]
  platform = ststm32
  board = nucleo_f401re

  upload_protocol = mbed

Debugging
---------

:ref:`piodebug` - "1-click" solution for debugging with a zero configuration.

.. warning::
    You will need to install debug tool drivers depending on your system.
    Please click on compatible debug tool below for the further
    instructions and configuration information.

You can switch between debugging :ref:`debugging_tools` using
:ref:`projectconf_debug_tool` option in :ref:`projectconf`.

ST Nucleo F401RE has on-board debug probe and **IS READY** for debugging. You don't need to use/buy external debug probe.

Frameworks
----------
.. list-table::
    :header-rows:  1

    * - Name
      - Description

    * - :ref:`framework_cmsis`
      - The ARM Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) is a vendor-independent hardware abstraction layer for the Cortex-M processor series and specifies debugger interfaces. The CMSIS enables consistent and simple software interfaces to the processor for interface peripherals, real-time operating systems, and middleware. It simplifies software re-use, reducing the learning curve for new microcontroller developers and cutting the time-to-market for devices.

    * - :ref:`framework_mbed`
      - The mbed framework The mbed SDK has been designed to provide enough hardware abstraction to be intuitive and concise, yet powerful enough to build complex projects. It is built on the low-level ARM CMSIS APIs, allowing you to code down to the metal if needed. In addition to RTOS, USB and Networking libraries, a cookbook of hundreds of reusable peripheral and module libraries have been built on top of the SDK by the mbed Developer Community.

    * - :ref:`framework_spl`
      - The ST Standard Peripheral Library provides a set of functions for handling the peripherals on the STM32 Cortex-M3 family. The idea is to save the user (the new user, in particular) having to deal directly with the registers.

    * - :ref:`framework_stm32cube`
      - STM32Cube embedded software libraries, including: The HAL hardware abstraction layer, enabling portability between different STM32 devices via standardized API calls; The Low-Layer (LL) APIs, a light-weight, optimized, expert oriented set of APIs designed for both performance and runtime efficiency.
