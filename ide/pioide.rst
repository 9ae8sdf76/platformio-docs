PlatformIO IDE
==============

Integration
-----------

We provide official packages (plugins, extensions) for the most popular IDEs
and text editors.

Atom
~~~~

**Atom** is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the
coreâ€”a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without
ever touching a config file.

VSCode
~~~~~~

**Visual Studio Code** is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which
runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes
with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich
ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Python, PHP,
Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity)
