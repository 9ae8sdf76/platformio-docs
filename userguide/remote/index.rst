PIO Remoteâ„¢ CLI
===============

:ref:`pio_remote` allows you to work remotely with devices from
*Anywhere In The World*. No matter where are you now! Run a small and
cross-platform :ref:`cmd_remote_agent` on a remote machine and you are able to
list active devices (wireless + wired), to upload firmware (program),
to process remote unit tests, or to start remote debugging session via
**Remote Serial Port Monitor**.

Using :ref:`pio_remote` you can share your devices with friends or team. In
combination with Cloud IDE, you can create awesome things at any time when
inspiration comes to you.

You should have :ref:`cmd_account` to work with :ref:`pio_remote`.
