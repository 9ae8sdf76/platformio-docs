Drivers
-------

:Windows:
	See https://community.platformio.org/t/esp32-pio-unified-debugger/4541/20

:Mac:
	macOS contains default FTDIUSBSerialDriver driver which conflicts with
	debug tools which are based on this chip. FTDI Chip company recommends
	removing this default driver from a system. Everything should work after system rebooting. See detailed instruction in official application note
	(Page 16, Section 4: Uninstalling FTDI Drivers on OS X)
	`AN134: FTDI Drivers Installation guide for MAC OS X <http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/AppNotes/AN_134_FTDI_Drivers_Installation_Guide_for_MAC_OSX.pdf>`__

:Linux:
	Please install "udev" rules :ref:`faq_udev_rules`. If you already installed
	them before, please check that your rules are up-to-date or repeat steps.
