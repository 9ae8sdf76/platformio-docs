PIO Remote™
===========

**Your devices are always with you!**

.. versionadded:: 3.2 (`PlatformIO Plus <https://pioplus.com>`__)

|PIORemote| allows you to work remotely with devices from
*Anywhere In The World*. No matter where are you now! Run small and
cross-platform :ref:`cmd_remote_agent` on a host machine and you will be able to
list active devices (wireless + wired), to upload firmware **Over-The-Air (OTA)**,
to process remote unit tests, or to start remote debugging session via OTA
Serial Port Monitor.

Using PIO Remote™ you can share your devices with friends or team. In
combination with Cloud IDE, you can create awesome things at any time when
inspiration comes to you.

You should have :ref:`cmd_account` to work with |PIORemote|.
A registration is **FREE**.

Technology
----------

.. image:: ../_static/pio-remote-architecture.png

|PIORemote| is an own `PlatformIO Plus <https://pioplus.com/>`__ technology for
**Over-The-Air (OTA)** remote operations without external dependencies to
operation system or its software based on `client-server architecture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client–server_model>`_.
The Server component (|PIOCloud|) plays a role of coupling link between
:ref:`cmd_remote_agent` and client (end-developer, continuous integration
system, etc.).
When you start :ref:`cmd_remote_agent`, it connects over the Internet with
|PIOCloud| and listen for the actions/commands which you can send in Client
role from anywhere in the world.

|PIORemote| is multi-agents and multi-clients system. A single agent can be
shared with multiple clients, where different clients can use the same agent.
This approach allows to work with distributed hardware located in the different
places, networks, etc.

This technology allows to work with remote devices in generic form as you
do that with host devices using PlatformIO ecosystem. The only one difference
is a prefix "remote" before each generic PlatformIO command. For example,
listing of host and remote devices will look like :ref:`cmd_device_list` and
:ref:`cmd_remote_device_list`.

Quick Start
-----------

1.  Install :ref:`core`. Please note that :ref:`core` is built-in in
    :ref:`ide_atom`. No need to install it separately, use
    PlatformIO IDE Terminal to access for ``pio`` and ``platformio`` commands.

2.  Start |PIORemote| Agent using :ref:`cmd_remote_agent_start` command on a
    **target machine** where devices are connected physically or are visible
    via network. |PIORemote| **Agent works on Windows, macOS, Linux and Linux ARMv6+**.
    It means that you can use desktop machine, laptop or credit card sized PC
    (RaspberryPi, BeagleBoard, etc).

    You can share own devices/hardware with friends, team or other developers
    using :option:`platformio remote agent start --share` option.

3.  Using **host machine** or :ref:`ide_cloud` Terminal in the browser, please authorize
    via :ref:`cmd_account_login` command with the same credentials that you
    used on the previous step. Now, you can use :ref:`cmd_remote` commands to
    work with **target machine** and its devices Over-The-Air (OTA).

    You don't need to have network or other access to host machine where
    |PIORemote| Agent is started.

.. note::
    Please use local IP as "upload port" when device is not connected directly
    to host machine where |PIORemote| Agent is started but supports natively
    Over-the-Air (OTA) updates. For example, :ref:`platform_espressif8266` and
    :ref:`platform_espressif_ota`. In this case, the final command for remote
    OTA update will look as ``platformio remote run -t upload --upload-port 192.168.0.255``
    or ``platformio remote run -t upload --upload-port myesp8266.local``.
